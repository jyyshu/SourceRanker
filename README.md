# CPSC 210 Project

## A literature ranking tool for research

### What will the application *do*?
- This application will be used a tool to sort through various forms of scientific literature and information sources 
 available online. Source literature that this tool is intended for is primarily peer reviewed journal articles, reviews,
books, newspaper publications, and theses' to name a few. 

- The software itself will use various parameters (that can be included or not based on user 
preference) in order to filter and rank these sources. 
- *Examples of such parameters include:*
    - range of time from which source was published
    - authors of interest 
    - specific journals to be included
    - specific methods, genes etc used in study or review

- **Ultimately, this tool will comb through a pool of source material (submitted by the user), and determine how overrepresented the parameters 
included are (as defined by the user) and produce a ranking to facilitate one's literature search.**

### *Who* will use it?
- This application is intended for researchers, students, and or casual users to assist their pursuit for the most
important and/or relevant sources to use that are reflective of their research interests and/or goals.

### *Why* is this project of interest to you?
- Based on prior experience from school work as well as my experience as a bioinformatics 
research student in acute myeloid leukemia research, literature searches can often be a very time-consuming 
and arduous process. Often times, I had hoped for a tool or application that would aid me in this venture, as existing
methods online would either be too general or too specific for my needs. Therefore, I hope to create a literature ranking
search application that would offer enough personalization and custom settings that would not only cater towards the needs of the many while 
also being precise enough for the needs of specific individuals or groups. In general, I aim to
expedite and simplify the literature searching process and hopefully help others who may encounter 
similar difficulties that I have addressed already

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to input multiple parameters/keywords to assess the rank score for each source (one after another)
- As a user, I would like to view the list of sources already imported in the tool showing each source title and rank score (with a larger rank score indicating higher importance)
- As a user, I want to add multiple sources to be ranked within the application
- As a user, I want to remove a source from the list of sources based on its position within the list

- As a user, I want to have the ability to save the list of sources that I have imported at any point
- As a user, I want to be able to choose to re-load my source list that I previously saved from file
