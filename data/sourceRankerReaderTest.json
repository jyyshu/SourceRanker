    "body": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a clonal malignant disease with poor prognosis and a low overall survival rate. Although many studies on the treatment and detection of AML have been conducted, the molecular mechanism of AML development and progression has not been fully elucidated. The present study was designed to pursuit the molecular mechanism of AML using a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis, and build an applicable model to predict the survival probability of AML patients in clinical use."

No significant differences were found in the photosynthetic rates between the two conditions."

    "body": "Aberrant activation of RAS influences a variety of cellular pathways, the majority of which have been highlighted in RAS pathway v2.0. Despite this knowledge, efforts to attenuate RAS activity through the therapeutic inhibition of downstream signaling molecules have been relatively unsuccessful, in large part due to the ability of RAS signaling pathways to \u201crewire\u201d, increasing therapeutic resistance1,2. Given our current inability to directly inhibit RAS, identification of an essential downstream target in RAS-driven cancers would be highly valuable. Here, we discuss RAS-mediated posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of c-MYC (MYC) that increase MYC activity and position MYC as a critical effector of RAS-driven cancer."
