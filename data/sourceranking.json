No significant differences were found in the photosynthetic rates between the two conditions."

        "body": "Aberrant activation of RAS influences a variety of cellular pathways, the majority of which have been highlighted in RAS pathway v2.0. Despite this knowledge, efforts to attenuate RAS activity through the therapeutic inhibition of downstream signaling molecules have been relatively unsuccessful, in large part due to the ability of RAS signaling pathways to \u201crewire\u201d, increasing therapeutic resistance1,2. Given our current inability to directly inhibit RAS, identification of an essential downstream target in RAS-driven cancers would be highly valuable. Here, we discuss RAS-mediated posttranslational modifications (PTMs) of c-MYC (MYC) that increase MYC activity and position MYC as a critical effector of RAS-driven cancer."
